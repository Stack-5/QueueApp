# NEUQueue

**NEUQueue** is an innovative queuing automation solution designed for **New Era University**. During peak periods—like **enrollment, graduation, payment, document retrieval, or consultations**—students often face long, overwhelming lines that sometimes spill across multiple rooms. NEUQueue aims to fix that.

Instead of physically standing in line, students can simply **scan a QR code**, register their purpose of visit, and instantly join a **virtual queue**. The app will intelligently suggest available counters or cashiers, minimizing wait times and overcrowding.

## Key Features

-  **QR Code Scanning** for quick check-ins  
-  **Purpose-based Registration** to guide queue routing  
-  **Dynamic Cashier Assignment** based on availability  
-  **Real-time Virtual Queueing** so students can wait from anywhere  
-  **Notifications** for when it’s their turn  

##  The Goal

To **simplify**, **automate**, and **optimize** NEU’s queueing system—making campus visits faster, more efficient, and stress-free for both students and staff.
